        A poll shows nearly half of teachers in England plan to quit within the
        next five years. Ahead of the National Education Union (NEU) annual
        conference in Bournemouth this week, it published data on Monday
        revealing that <strong>44% </strong>of teachers plan to leave the
        profession by 2027. In a survey of 1,788 teachers, a fifth (22%) said
        they would leave within two years. Teachers said their heavy workload
        was a significant factor in their decision to leave. More than half of
        respondents <strong>52% </strong> said the workload was “unmanageable”
        or “unmanageable most of the time”, up from 35% in 2021. For those
        planning to leave within two years, workload was the key motivation for
        65% of respondents, while concerns about the level of trust in teachers
        from the public and government were also a significant factor. Teachers
        also cited pay and accountability as reasons to consider leaving. “I am
        desperate to get out of education due to workload, constant monitoring
        and paperwork,” one teacher said. Teachers said schools were finding it
        difficult to fill vacancies, leading to a doubling up of roles, with 73%
        reporting the issue had got worse since the start of the pandemic.
        “People leave and then their responsibilities [are] added to another
        role,” one teacher said. Another described how “everything is pared to
        the bone”. “We have increased leadership responsibilities but our time
        to carry this out has been axed,” they added. “Classes are covered by
        teaching assistants on a regular basis, as if this is perfectly
        satisfactory.” Two-thirds of secondary school teachers (66%) said the
        issue of vacant teaching assistant and support staff posts had worsened
        since March 2020. One respondent said there were
        <strong>“far too few”</strong> teaching assistants and they were being
        asked to cover classes more than ever before. For those who had thought
        about stress at work, two-thirds reported they were stressed at least
        60% of the time, with one teacher reporting that stretched staffing had
        left staff “close to burnout”.
